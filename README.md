# Heat-Equation-Simulation
#Heat Equation simulation using serveral numerical methods

This is an examples of the applied numerical computation on heat equation (simple conduction). I conducted and commited the codes in linux and used 
paraview as am interface. This work is in progress, I will continuously update them weekly or less.

Feel free to explore my amateur work!
